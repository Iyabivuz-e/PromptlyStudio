#  StackGenie

**StackGenie** is an open-source AI-powered fullstack framework that generates complete web applications from a single natural language prompt.

It combines the flexibility of modern frontend tools (React/Vue + Tailwind CSS), backend frameworks (Node.js + Express for MVP), and the power of OpenAI to deliver an instant and intelligent developer experience.

---

## Features (MVP)

- **AI-Prompt Project Generation**  
  Describe your idea in plain English (e.g. "An app with login and dashboard") and get full code in seconds.

-  **Backend Scaffolding**  
  Generates backend using Node.js + Express with user authentication out of the box.

- **Frontend Generator**  
  Supports React or Vue 3, with Tailwind CSS or Material UI styling.

-  **CLI Tool**  
  Easily initialize a project with `stackgenie create`.

-  **Modular Components**  
  Reusable components and features: Auth, Dashboard, Forms, etc.

##  Target Users

- Developers and makers who want to build fast
- Tech communities and open-source contributors
- African innovators aiming to create tools for the continent
- Educators and bootcamp learners

##  Community Vision

> StackGenie is more than a framework — it's a community-powered initiative to empower developers across Africa with modern, intelligent dev tools.

We’re starting with a strong community from **React Rwanda** and opening it up to developers around the continent and beyond.
